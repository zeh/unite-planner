He founded the world's largest non-profit educational jazz festival in honor of his father, Frank. And during his time at Seattle-based digital agency POP, his team developed and managed the websites, mobile apps, e-commerce, and email programs for organizations like Carnegie Hall, the Sydney Opera House, the Royal Opera House, and the Metropolitan Opera. Joe also led the development of one of the first mobile ticketing platforms, a highly-scalable ticket engine, and in partnership with his long-time hero Frank Gehry, he led the design of digital installations for New York City's new Signature Theatre.\n\nDon't tell anyone, but before working for agencies, Joe sang backup vocals for artists like the Steve Miller Band, Bonnie Raitt, and Kurt Elling.",

You will learn about the performance advantages that SRP can bring to projects targeting mobile platforms, VR and games with limited real-time lighting needs. You will also find out how the rendering features differ from the built-in renderer in a way that improves performance in limited platforms. Finally, you will learn how to get started using SRP for your project."

In this intermediate-level session, we'll cover best practices for creating 3D-180 video for distribution and playback in Oculus Go and other VR headsets through a live workshop. After discussing camera hardware, software tools, real-world differences between 180 and 360, spatial audio, and best practices in shooting, editing, encoding, and distribution, we will actually shoot, edit, and distribute a short video for viewing in Oculus Go."

He started realizing his dream around 2000, when he joined his first non-profit indie group. Around the same time, he decided that what he really loves about game development is not creating games themselves but creating technology that allows others to build games they dream about. This discovery pushed him down a long and difficult path of engine development. Multiple indie and AAA game projects later, he is still passionate about his work. Since 2017, he has worked in Unity's Copenhagen office, where he focuses on C++ containers, low-level memory management, and tools to investigate memory issues.",

Their goal was to bring the creative process back into the shots on set, as if it was all practical shooting.

Prior to the motion-picture industry, Wes studied fine arts, working in oils and charcoal but ultimately incorporating his love for computers into a master's thesis utilizing real-time animation and interaction in traditional media. After university, Wes joined the video game industry as a software developer, focusing on visual effects, physics, and animation, among many other areas that sparked his interest. He was a primary developer for the Need for Speed racing franchise and worked on other products such as James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
