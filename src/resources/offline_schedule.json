You'll also hear the story of how Dan Sagmiller developed an RTS in four hours. What's more, the game was complete with an AI enemy who was building bases (and sending ever-growing units to attack), resources, sort of a fog of war, a functional tech tree and more.

Virality features like referral campaigns, game design for social UA will decrease CPI. Also, data shows that socially acquired users retain 3x time longer.\n- Virality metrics: k-factor, invites per mile, invites per user\n\n# Three levels of virality features\n- L1: add share button. Easy, but useless\n- L2: incentivized sharing. Requires logic to handle reward on client + optionally backend to properly validate sharing the result. Number of users you can get.\n- L3: integrate sharing to tutorial, quests, gameplay. Requires effort from developers + game designers. Can deliver recurring friend invites from users."

Advances in Machine Learning (ML) now allow developers to easily leverage Natural Language Understanding through reusable techniques. The combination of XR+AI is a powerful integration that opens new possibilities for both gaming, entertainment and enterprise scenarios.\n\nThis intermediate session is an exploration of how speech and language understanding can be used to augment Mixed Reality & VR experiences. We'll explore the use of speech recognition & Natural Language Understanding to build advanced voice commands, translate languages from within XR environments, and also look at the creation of intelligent conversation assistants to be used as interactive entities in Mixed Reality and VR apps & games. In a world where speech is the primary form of input, using Machine Learning to process language input and understand the user's intent is of paramount importance."

By night, Joe is head of TiltShift, Publicis Groupe's VR\/immersive reality consultancy and production studio.\n \nBefore joining Team One, Joe opened and led the Razorfish Los Angeles office, where he managed the Honda and Acura digital agency of record account. He led the T-Mobile digital account during its industry-revolutionizing \"Un-carrier\" brand relaunch, and worked with companies like Visa, Amazon, and Qualcomm.\n \nJoe is recognized for implementing transformative ideas in complex organizations, including a global enterprise technology strategy he led for Procter & Gamble, which Apple featured in a case study in their marketing.\n \nIn addition to helping some of the world's leading brands develop and implement their digital strategies, Joe has a passion for the arts. He founded the world's largest non-profit educational jazz festival in honor of his father, Frank. And during his time at Seattle-based digital agency POP, his team developed and managed the websites, mobile apps, e-commerce, and email programs for organizations like Carnegie Hall, the Sydney Opera House, the Royal Opera House, and the Metropolitan Opera. Joe also led the development of one of the first mobile ticketing platforms, a highly-scalable ticket engine, and in partnership with his long-time hero Frank Gehry, he led the design of digital installations for New York City's new Signature Theatre.\n\nDon't tell anyone, but before working for agencies, Joe sang backup vocals for artists like the Steve Miller Band, Bonnie Raitt, and Kurt Elling.",

He has worked on 15+ commercial projects, including Rock Band 3, The Sims 2, and Death Jr (a game about the son of the grim reaper). Since 2010, he has shifted his focus to web development working on HTML5 games and products like Gliffy, a graphical diagram editor for the web. He's mega-enthusiastic about technologies like WebGL and WebAssembly, and thinks the web will become the preferred delivery platform for games by 2025.

In this intermediate-level session, we'll cover best practices for creating 3D-180 video for distribution and playback in Oculus Go and other VR headsets through a live workshop. After discussing camera hardware, software tools, real-world differences between 180 and 360, spatial audio, and best practices in shooting, editing, encoding, and distribution, we will actually shoot, edit, and distribute a short video for viewing in Oculus Go."

In this session we'll talk about how using mixed reality can transform your VR experience and take it to the next level. Mixed reality allows people to see the participant in the VR experience, interacting with the VR world. Mixed reality makes your VR experience a more social and engaging experience. We've seen how much more engaged spectators are when watching people play games via mixed reality; learn how to take that same concept and apply it to other industries and use cases. MixCast by Blueprint Reality integrates easily with your Unity VR project and allows you to easily create high quality mixed reality digital pics and videos, with or without a green screen."

He started realizing his dream around 2000, when he joined his first non-profit indie group. Around the same time, he decided that what he really loves about game development is not creating games themselves but creating technology that allows others to build games they dream about. This discovery pushed him down a long and difficult path of engine development. Multiple indie and AAA game projects later, he is still passionate about his work. Since 2017, he has worked in Unity's Copenhagen office, where he focuses on C++ containers, low-level memory management, and tools to investigate memory issues.",

The result was Vancouver-based Digital Monarch Media (DMM), where traditional filmmaking ideologies meet real-time game-engine technology via their Virtual Film Tools suite. Their goal was to bring the creative process back into the shots on set, as if it was all practical shooting.

Prior to the motion-picture industry, Wes studied fine arts, working in oils and charcoal but ultimately incorporating his love for computers into a master's thesis utilizing real-time animation and interaction in traditional media. After university, Wes joined the video game industry as a software developer, focusing on visual effects, physics, and animation, among many other areas that sparked his interest. He was a primary developer for the Need for Speed racing franchise and worked on other products such as James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare. His career in digital entertainment finally led him to Microsoft Studios and later DMM, where he joined with friends, new and old, to bring these ideas into the foundations that so many creatives are using today.",

Led by Igor Simi\u0107, a graduate of Columbia University, they worked on \ufb01lm projects, most notably The Thinker in the Supermarket, Cost-Bene\ufb01t-Love and Melancholic Drone, which were awarded and screened in \ufb01lm festivals and in the contemporary art context. Igor is represented by Galerie Anita Beckers in Frankfurt. A collective exhibition, Virtual Insanity, began August 3, 2018, at Kunsthalle Mainz. In the meantime, Demagog Studio created two video games as art projects, Crisis Expert, an in\ufb01nite runner on an economic graph, and Children's Play, a game about a factory where children make toys. The development team consists of Ivan Stankovi\u0107, Milo\u0161 Milojevi\u0107 and Milo\u0161 Mihajlovi\u0107. For Golf Club: Wasteland, the team expanded to include the architect and art director Nikola Stepkovi\u0107 who created all the art for Golf Club: Wasteland, while Shane Berry, formerly Tokyo-based DJ and now Paris-based musician, is the sound designer and composer of the album. The company was of\ufb01cially founded in 2017 with the aim to focus on \ufb01lm, video, games and music.",
